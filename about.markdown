My online name is Outofanser. I have a PhD in Physics and work as an engineer and analyst. Gaming is a passion of mine, and I love game design and coding.
I am currently learning Unity (and C#) for game design but I'm also dabbling in Godot and am interested in designing simple game engines in C++.
I also have interest in learning some Machine Learning techniques and have taken some courses, but I need practice in python (someone help me set up libraries).

This web portfolio is dedicated to the myriad of coding that I learn as well as projects that I take on. I hope to come back to these pages
and reflect fondly on the progress I've made.

I'm not a professional programmer, but here are the programming languages I have some experience with:
1. Matlab 
2. C#
3. C++
4. Python
